## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **determined and self-motivated IT graduate** who started university later in life while working as a waiter to fund my education. That journey built my resilience, shaped my work ethic, and inspired me to aim higher.

Graduated **cum laude** and received the **Vice Chancellor’s Award** for being the top academic achiever in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. My experience includes hands-on software development across front-end, back-end, databases, DevOps, and testing — and I thrive in creative, collaborative teams that deliver.
